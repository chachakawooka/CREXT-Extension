# CREXT Browser Extension

## Create transaction
- To use the extension to create and sign transaction, you can use the `CREXT.sendTransaction` function.
- Calling this function creates a popup with the entered details. A user can choose to accept this transaction.

```JavaScript
CREXT.sendTransaction({
  id: "This id gets returned in the result",
  target: "7tiMoADn9VJfP3xEf58BAUj85mJuGmfqTyN86JeCk9TA",
  amount: "1.0",
  fee: "1.0"
})
.then(function(val) {
  console.log(val);
})
.catch(function(val) {
  console.log(val);
});
```

- A successful result will look like this.
- Currently it forwards the default response given via a node.

```ObjDump
{
  success: true,
  id: "This id gets returned in the result",
  result: {
    roundNum: 1309526,
    smart_contract_result: null,
    status: {
      code: 0,
      message: "Success 35000000000042A4D652F43CF6E3A536E068AFB27344F7CE5C1FBC42591B3B5C5DD2CEE849C3666581D016A55029F009CE2D555E6682CAA97A3AEEF49A06EA1CB9FDE9101B55010000000000000000000000664C0100"
    }
  }
}
```

- A rejected transaction will look like this.

```ObjDump
{
  success: true,
  id: "This id gets returned in the result",
  message: "Transaction rejected by user"
}
```

- If a user closes the popup, it will result in the following message.

```ObjDump
{
  success: true,
  id: "This id gets returned in the result",
  message: "Window closed by user"
}
```
