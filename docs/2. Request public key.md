# CREXT Browser Extension

## Request public key
- If you want that a user can log in to your platform with their public key, you can request the public key with the `CREXT.getKey()` function. An example is shown below.
- A promise is returned upon this request.
- Upon the first request done, a user will have to give a website permission to read data.

```JavaScript
CREXT.getKey()
.then(function(val) { // Success
  console.log(val);
})
.catch(function(val) { // Failed
  console.log(val);
});
```

- A successful result will look like this

```ObjDump
{
  success: true,
  result: {
    publicKey: "5V9h5DvH9nPiiVEifnZ8716d2SQ5udTkFnuBRqCkkuvi"
  }
}
```
